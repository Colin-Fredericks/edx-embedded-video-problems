	Video-Embedded Problems Controller!

	The table below tells us what time (in seconds) each problem will pop up.
	Problems are called by name - make sure the name matches exactly and there are no duplicates.
	Note that every row but the last one needs a comma.

// All of these are optional; feel free to chuck any or all of them.
// They set the window width, appearance/disappearance effects, and location.
